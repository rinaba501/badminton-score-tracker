//
//  Single source of truth for every UserDefaults / @AppStorage key the app
//  persists. Only the key *strings* live here — typed defaults stay at each
//  @AppStorage declaration site, because several reference app-only types
//  (CourtTheme, SettingsView.GameMode). New persisted keys must be added
//  here, never as inline string literals — and if the new key should sync
//  across devices, it must ALSO be added to the SyncKeys list in the app's
//  CloudSyncManager.swift; membership there is what opts a key into iCloud.
