# Badminton Score Tracker — Feature Spec

Living specification for the watchOS app. Every PR that adds or changes a feature must update this file.

---

## Platform

- **Target:** watchOS (Apple Watch)
- **Language:** Swift / SwiftUI
- **Persistence:** `@AppStorage` (UserDefaults) with JSON-encoded structs
- **Audio:** `AVAudioEngine` + programmatic sine-wave tone generation (no audio files)
- **Health:** `HealthKit` — logs each match as a `.badminton` `HKWorkoutSession`; activity type indoor
- **Sync:** `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore` — syncs player roster, match history, and settings via iCloud; pushes on data change, pulls on launch and on external update

---

## Screens

### Menu
- New Match → opens Pre-Match
- Match History → opens History
- Player Stats → opens Stats
- Settings → opens Settings

### Watch Face Complication
- Circular, corner, inline, and rectangular complication families supported
- Tapping any complication deep-links to Pre-Match via `badminton://newmatch`
- Complication source in `badminton score tracker Complication/` — separate WidgetKit extension target

### Pre-Match
Two-step flow:
1. **Near Side** — pick yourself or a roster player or a guest
2. **Far Side** — pick opponent (excludes Near Side selection); selecting immediately starts the match

### Game Screen
- **Tap** top/bottom half to score for that player
- **Undo** button (inline in header) — reverts last point; disabled during game-over overlay
- **Digital Crown** — rotate to score (clockwise = me, counter-clockwise = opponent)
- **Serve indicator** — small dot next to serving player's name; side (left/right) reflects service court (even score = right, odd = left)
- **Game-point / Match-point banner** — red banner at top when either side is one point from winning
- **Score pulse animation** — score number pulses on each point
- **Winner glow** — winning player's avatar turns gold when game ends
- **Game-over overlay** — shows game result and "Next Game" button; serve auto-assigns to the game winner (correct badminton rules)
- **Match-over overlay** — shows trophy, winner name, games score, "New Match" button

### Match History
- Lists all completed matches in reverse chronological order
- Each row: player names, games won, per-game scores, date, duration
- Swipe to delete individual records
- "Clear All" button with confirmation
- **Filter by player** — picker to show only matches involving a specific player (hidden if only one player in history)
- **Filter by date range** — All Time / This Week / This Month

### Player Stats
- Win rate, total matches, win/loss streak per player
- Filtered to the configured "Me" player
- **Head-to-Head** section listing W–L record against each opponent in history

### Pre-Match (opponent picker)
- Roster rows show H2H record (`XW – YL`) against the near-side player when picking an opponent; hidden if no prior matches exist

### Settings
- **Me** section — single tappable row showing avatar + name; opens Player Edit
- **Players** section — roster list; tap to edit, swipe to delete
- **Game Mode** — Singles / Doubles (Doubles UI not yet implemented)
- **Match Format** — Points to win (11 / 15 / 21), Games in match (1 / 3 / 5)
- **Match Timer** — toggle on/off; when enabled, duration stepper (±1 min, ±5 min buttons; min 1, max 99, default 10)
- **Court Theme** — Green / Blue / Red / Purple / Black
- **Digital Crown** — toggle crown scoring on/off (default on); off prevents accidental scoring from wrist movement
- **Score Announcement** — toggle spoken score via `AVSpeechSynthesizer`
- **Sound Effects** — toggle programmatic tones
- **Controls** — permanent gesture reference screen (tap, crown directions, undo)

---

## Scoring Rules

- Win a game at `pointsToWin` (default 21) with a 2-point lead
- Cap at `pointsToWin + 9` (default 30) — at 29-29 the 30th point wins
- Win the match by winning `ceil(gamesInMatch / 2)` games (default best-of-3)
- Serve changes on every rally won (rally point scoring)
- Serve indicator is hidden at 0-0; appears from the first point onward
- Service court: right when server's score is even, left when odd

### Match Timer mode
- All scoring rules above still apply (games end at 21, match ends at 2 games won, etc.)
- A countdown timer is shown above the games header
- Timer turns red in the last 30 seconds
- Timer pauses at zero — does not tick during game-over overlay
- **When timer reaches 0:**
  - Leader by games won → wins the match immediately
  - Tied on games → leader by current game score wins the match
  - Fully tied → **Sudden Death**: next point wins the match
- If a player wins the required games before the timer runs out, the match ends normally

## Players & Roster

- Players have: `id: UUID`, `name: String`, `colorIndex: Int`, `iconName: String?`
- **Avatar** — circle with player color; shows asset image, SF Symbol, or initials fallback
- **15 avatar images** — shuttlecock, racket, and character stickers (transparent PNG)
- **12 SF Symbol sport icons** — star, bolt, flame, crown, etc.
- **12 avatar colors** — blue, green, orange, purple, pink, red, cyan, mint, teal, indigo, yellow, brown
- Roster players are saved on first match with a new name
- New players can be created from either the pre-match picker or Settings, with color and icon selection available at creation time
- **"Me" player** — stored in roster like any other player; shown under "Me" section in Settings, hidden from the Players list
- Duplicate names are rejected when renaming (alert shown)
- Renaming a player propagates to all match history records that reference their `UUID`

---

## Match History Storage

- `MatchRecord` fields: `id`, `games: [GameScore]`, `myGamesWon`, `opponentGamesWon`, `winner`, `myName`, `opponentName`, `date`, `duration`, `myPlayerId: UUID?`, `opponentPlayerId: UUID?`
- Player IDs are stored at match-save time by looking up names in the current roster
- Old records without IDs fall back to stored name strings
- When a player is renamed, all history records referencing their ID are updated
- iCloud sync reconciles history by record id (a new match recorded on either device survives a sync); deleting a match or clearing all history pushes as an authoritative overwrite instead, so the deletion isn't undone by a stale copy still on iCloud

## Sound & Haptics

| Event | Haptic | Tone |
|---|---|---|
| Point scored | `.click` | 880 Hz, 0.18s |
| Game point reached | `.notification` | 740 Hz, 0.18s |
| Game won | `.success` + `.retry` | C5→E5 |
| Match won | `.success` × 2 | C5→E5→G5 fanfare |
| Undo | `.directionUp` | — |
| Sudden death | `.notification` | — |

- Score announcement via `AVSpeechSynthesizer` — server score first, then receiver score
- "love" used for 0 in English; katakana numbers in Japanese; numerals in Chinese/other
- Language auto-detected from device locale

---

## Animations

- **Racket animation** — plays on game start before score UI appears
- **Score pulse** — scale animation on score number each point
- **Winner glow** — avatar transitions to yellow on game win
- **Trophy shimmer** — match-over overlay trophy pulses

---

## Localization

Supported languages: English, Japanese (ja), Chinese Simplified (zh-Hans), Indonesian (id), Korean (ko), Hindi (hi)

The default local-player name ("Me") and the two guest labels offered during player selection are fully localized. These strings double as identity markers (a guest selection must never be saved to the roster), so every screen reads them from a single shared source (`Player.defaultMyName`/`.guestNearLabel`/`.guestFarLabel`) rather than each hardcoding its own copy — otherwise a guest chosen in one locale's label could fail the "is this a guest" check.

---

## Accessibility

- **VoiceOver** — custom controls carry spoken labels:
  - Each score tile reads the player, current score, and (while serving) the service court as one element, with a "double tap to add a point" hint and the button trait.
  - The games-won readout, the undo button, and the match-timer countdown have dedicated labels.
  - Purely decorative imagery (avatars beside names, timer/trophy icons) is hidden from VoiceOver to avoid redundant elements.
- All accessibility strings are localized in every supported language (`a11y.*` keys in `Localizable.strings`).
