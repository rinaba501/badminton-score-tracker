# Badminton Score Tracker — Feature Spec

Living specification for the watchOS app. Every PR that adds or changes a feature must update this file.

---

## Platform

- **Target:** watchOS (Apple Watch)
- **Language:** Swift / SwiftUI
- **Persistence:** `@AppStorage` (UserDefaults) with JSON-encoded structs
- **Audio:** `AVAudioEngine` + programmatic sine-wave tone generation (no audio files)

---

## Screens

### Menu
- New Match → opens Pre-Match
- Match History → opens History
- Player Stats → opens Stats
- Settings → opens Settings

### Pre-Match
Two-step flow:
1. **Near Side** — pick yourself or a roster player or a guest
2. **Far Side** — pick opponent (excludes Near Side selection); selecting immediately starts the match

### Game Screen
- **Tap** top/bottom half to score for that player
- **Long-press** to reset the current game (with confirmation)
- **Undo** button (inline in header) — reverts last point; disabled during game-over overlay
- **Digital Crown** — rotate to score (clockwise = me, counter-clockwise = opponent)
- **Serve indicator** — small dot next to serving player's name; side (left/right) reflects service court (even score = right, odd = left)
- **Game-point / Match-point banner** — red banner at top when either side is one point from winning
- **Score pulse animation** — score number pulses on each point
- **Winner glow** — winning player's avatar turns gold when game ends
- **Game-over overlay** — shows game result and "Next Game" button; serve auto-assigns to the game winner (correct badminton rules)
- **Match-over overlay** — shows trophy, winner name, games score, "New Match" button

### Match History
- Lists all completed matches in reverse chronological order
- Each row: player names, games won, per-game scores, date, duration
- Swipe to delete individual records
- "Clear All" button with confirmation

### Player Stats
- Win rate, total matches, win/loss streak per player
- Filtered to the configured "Me" player

### Settings
- **Me** section — single tappable row showing avatar + name; opens Player Edit
- **Players** section — roster list; tap to edit, swipe to delete
- **Game Mode** — Singles / Doubles (Doubles UI not yet implemented)
- **Match Format** — Points to win (11 / 15 / 21), Games in match (1 / 3 / 5)
- **Match Timer** — toggle on/off; when enabled, duration stepper (±1 min, ±5 min buttons; min 1, max 99, default 10)
- **Court Theme** — Green / Blue / Red / Purple / Black
- **Score Announcement** — toggle spoken score via `AVSpeechSynthesizer`
- **Sound Effects** — toggle programmatic tones

## Scoring Rules

- Win a game at `pointsToWin` (default 21) with a 2-point lead
- Cap at `pointsToWin + 9` (default 30) — at 29-29 the 30th point wins
- Win the match by winning `ceil(gamesInMatch / 2)` games (default best-of-3)
- Serve changes on every rally won (rally point scoring)
- Serve indicator is hidden at 0-0; appears from the first point onward
- Service court: right when server's score is even, left when odd

### Match Timer mode
- All scoring rules above still apply (games end at 21, match ends at 2 games won, etc.)
- A countdown timer is shown above the games header
- Timer turns red in the last 30 seconds
- Timer pauses at zero — does not tick during game-over overlay
- **When timer reaches 0:**
  - Leader by games won → wins the match immediately
  - Tied on games → leader by current game score wins the match
  - Fully tied → **Sudden Death**: next point wins the match
- If a player wins the required games before the timer runs out, the match ends normally

## Players & Roster

- Players have: `id: UUID`, `name: String`, `colorIndex: Int`, `iconName: String?`
- **Avatar** — circle with player color; shows asset image, SF Symbol, or initials fallback
- **15 avatar images** — shuttlecock, racket, and character stickers (transparent PNG)
- **12 SF Symbol sport icons** — star, bolt, flame, crown, etc.
- **12 avatar colors** — blue, green, orange, purple, pink, red, cyan, mint, teal, indigo, yellow, brown
- Roster players are saved on first match with a new name
- **"Me" player** — stored in roster like any other player; shown under "Me" section in Settings, hidden from the Players list
- Duplicate names are rejected when renaming (alert shown)
- Renaming a player propagates to all match history records that reference their `UUID`

---

## Match History Storage

- `MatchRecord` fields: `id`, `games: [GameScore]`, `myGamesWon`, `opponentGamesWon`, `winner`, `myName`, `opponentName`, `date`, `duration`, `myPlayerId: UUID?`, `opponentPlayerId: UUID?`
- Player IDs are stored at match-save time by looking up names in the current roster
- Old records without IDs fall back to stored name strings
- When a player is renamed, all history records referencing their ID are updated
